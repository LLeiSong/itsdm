\title{Occurrence dataset of a virtual species}
\format{
A \code{data.frame} with 2000 rows and 2 fields
\describe{
\item{x (\code{numeric}) The x coordinates of the records in geographic coordinate system}
\item{y (\code{numeric}) The y coordinates of the records}}
}
\usage{
occ_virtual_species
}
\description{
A pseudo presence-only occurrence dataset of a virtual species made
by package \code{\link{virtualspecies}}.
}
\details{
The environmental niche of the virtual species is made by defining its
response functions to annual temperature and annual precipitation in mainland Africa.
The response function of annual temperature is normal distribution with
mean = 25 and standard deviation = 10.
The response function of annual precipitation is normal distribution with
mean = 1000 and standard deviation = 500.
Then the suitability is convert to presence-absence map by logistic conversion
with beta = 0.7, alpha = -0.05, and species prevalence = 0.27.
Finally 2000 presence-only points are sampled across the whole region.
