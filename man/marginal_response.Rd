\title{A function to calculate marginal responses of each variables.}
\usage{
marginal_response(model, var_occ, variables, si = 1000, visualize = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{Any predictive model. In this package, it could be isolation_forest.
In this package, it is isolation_forest.}

\item{var_occ}{(data.frame, tibble) the data.frame style table that
include values of environmental variables at occurrence locations.}

\item{variables}{(stars) The stars of environmental variables. It should have
multiple attributes instead of dims. If you have \code{raster} object instead, you
could use \code{st_as_stars} to convert it to \code{stars} or use \code{read_stars} directly
read source data as a \code{stars}.}

\item{si}{(integer) the number of samples to generate response curves.
If it is too small, the response curves might be biased.
The default value is 1000.}

\item{visualize}{(logical) if TRUE, plot the response curves.
The default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
(MarginalResponse) a nested list of data.frame of response and variable values.
The response values correspond to suitability of this single variable.
}
\description{
This function allows you to calculate the marginal responses of
each variables within the model.
}
\details{
The curves show how each environmental variable affects the modeling
prediction. The curves show how the predicted result changes as each environmental
variable is varied while keeping all other environmental variables at average
sample value. The curves might be hard to interpret if there are strongly correlated
variables. The users could use \code{dim_reduce} function to remove the strong correlation
from original environmental variable stack.

marginal_response(model = mod$model, variables = env_vars)
