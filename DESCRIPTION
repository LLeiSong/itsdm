Title: Isolation Forest-Based Presence-Only Species Distribution Modeling
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Lei Song
Maintainer: Lei Song <lsong@clarku.edu>
Description: This is a package to do purely presence-only species
    distribution modeling with isolation forest and variations such as
    SCiForest and EIF. It also provides functions to make response curves,
    analyze variable importance, analyze spatial dependence of variables
    and analyze variable contribution. As utilities, the package includes
    a few functions to download bioclimatic variables including worldclim
    version 2.0 and CMCC-BioClimInd. There are also functions to detect
    outliers in the occurrence dataset to do data cleaning.
